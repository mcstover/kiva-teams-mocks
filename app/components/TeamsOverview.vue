		<h2>Connect with Kiva's lender community</h2>
		<p>Lending teams are self-organized groups built around common interests, school affiliation or location.</p>
		<p>Join as many teams as you'd like, and rally around shared lending goals by counting each of your loans at checkout toward the team's impact.</p>
		<p>To get started, simply join an existing team or create a new one and invite your friends!</p>
